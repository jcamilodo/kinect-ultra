#summary How to download OpenNI and other related components.
#labels Featured

== Download ==

  * Download OpenNI and NITE from [http://www.openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx PrimeSense's site] and install them. *Select 32-bit version although your OS may be 64-bit.*
    * You may download the all-in-one package or download OpenNI and NITE individually. For example, if you want to download the all-in-one package, choose OpenNI Packages> Stable > PrimeSense Package Stable Build for Windows x86 (32-bit) vX.X.X.X Development Edition.
  * Download [https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect/Bin avin2's SensorKinect driver] and install it. *Select 32-bit version as well.*
    * Note this driver only supports Kinect for Xbox360 but not Kinect for Windows.
  * If interested, see WorkingConfigurations for the version combinations we tested.

== Using mssdk-openni-bridge bridge ==

  * mssdk-openni-bridge is a plug-in module for OpenNI that accesses to the Kinect sensor via Kinect SDK instead of SensorKinect driver. You may want to use it to workaround some issues such as:
    * If you install Kinect SDK, your Kinect sensor become unavalable on OpenNI because SensorKinect driver cannot connect to your Kinect sensor due to driver conflict. This bridge recovers your Kinect sensor back on OpenNI, and both OpenNI applications and Kinect SDK applications can use it without installing/uninstalling the driver.
    * SensorKinect driver only supports Kinect for Xbox360. But this bridge is built on Kinect SDK hence supports Kinect for Windows also. That means, you can now use Kinect for Windows on OpenNI by just installing this module.
  * To use this bridge, first download and install Kinect SDK (See [KinectSDK_Downloads]), then download the bridge from the [http://code.google.com/p/kinect-mssdk-openni-bridge/ kinect-mssdk-openni-bridge project site] and install it according to the README.
