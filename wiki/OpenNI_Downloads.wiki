== Download ==

  * Download OpenNI and NITE from the [http://www.openni.org/openni-sdk/openni-sdk-history-2/ archive site]. To use PrimeSense sensors (not Kinect), download the sensor driver as well. *Choose 32bit version regardless of whether your platform is 32bit or 64bit.*
  * To use Kinect, download Avin2's SensorKinect driver from [https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect/raw/unstable/Bin/ here] and install it. *Choose 32bit.* To avoid the driver conflict problems, consider using mssdk-openni-bridge introduced below.
  * If interested, see WorkingConfigurations for the tested version combinations.

== Using kinect-mssdk-openni-bridge ==

  * You cannot install SensorKinect driver and Microsoft Kinect SDK at the same time because of the driver conflict.
  * kinect-mssdk-openni-bridge is a replacement of SensorKinect to workaround this issue. This bridge leverages Kinect SDK to access to Kinect rather than conflicting to it.
  * To use this bridge, first download and install Kinect SDK (See [KinectSDK_Downloads]), then download the bridge from the [http://code.google.com/p/kinect-mssdk-openni-bridge/ kinect-mssdk-openni-bridge project site] and follow README to install it.
